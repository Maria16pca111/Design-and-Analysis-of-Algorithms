//Finding the Square root of a number
 m = which square root number you want to found
g1 = first guess
g2 = second guess
   = (g1 +(m/g1))/2
apply the same if you did not close to reach the no 
May be it was greater than or less than
   = (g2 + (m/g2))/2
   and approximate square root will be solved by
   if greater than we decrement by 1 
   if less than we increment by 0.1 
   if you have greater by accessing 0.1 reduce now as 0.01
   
   Note:
   Here, I noted for my knowledge for recalling whernever i need.
